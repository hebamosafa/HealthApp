# HealthApp
It's an Android App for providing easy and fast connection between the patient and his doctor, so it has two faces according to the user type (patient or doctor).
It allows the doctor to monitor the patient state remotely and be aware of the urgent cases. It removes theplace constraints by using relational database to send the patient medical info to the doctor and collect the sensors data like the heart rate & pressure.
The doctor also can send medical forms to his patients to fill it.
